Amazon Elastic File System (EFS): The Complete Guide

Introduction
Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) is a fully managed, scalable, and elastic network file storage service provided by AWS. It is designed to provide file storage for Linux-based workloads and allows multiple EC2 instances to access the same file system simultaneously, enabling high-performance, shared data scenarios.

Key Features of EFS
Elastic and Scalable:
Automatically scales up or down based on your storage needs.
No need for manual provisioning or capacity planning.
High Availability and Durability:
Data is stored across multiple Availability Zones (AZs).
Offers redundancy and resilience.
Access Across Multiple EC2 Instances:
Multiple EC2 instances can access the same EFS file system concurrently.
Supports workloads requiring shared data access.
Supports NFS (Network File System):
Built on the NFSv4 protocol, optimized for Linux/Unix workloads.
Lifecycle Management:
Automatically moves infrequently accessed files to a cost-effective storage class (EFS IA).
Secure:
Supports encryption at rest and in transit.
Integrated with IAM for fine-grained access control.
High Performance:
Supports throughput scaling and burst performance for intensive workloads.
Integration with AWS Services:
Works seamlessly with EC2, Lambda, ECS, EKS, and more.
When to Use EFS
EFS is suitable for the following scenarios:

Shared File Storage for Linux Workloads:
Web server clusters, application data sharing, and big data analytics.
Container Storage:
Persistent storage for containers in ECS and EKS.
Development Environments:
Centralized storage for development, build, and testing environments.
Media Processing:
Transcoding video files or processing large media datasets.
Big Data and Analytics:
Data sharing across analytics tools and pipelines.
Backup and Disaster Recovery:
Durable, high-availability storage for critical data.
Limitations and Use Cases Where EFS May Not Be Suitable
Applications Requiring Block Storage:
Why Not? EFS uses the NFS protocol, which is unsuitable for block-level storage.
Alternative: Use Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) or local instance storage for low-latency, high-performance workloads.
Massive Data Archiving:
Why Not? EFS is not cost-effective for storing large amounts of infrequently accessed data.
Alternative: Use Amazon S3 with lifecycle policies to move data to S3 Glacier or S3 Deep Archive.
Low-Latency, High-Performance Applications:
Why Not? EFS is optimized for shared access but might not match EBS or local storage in latency-sensitive scenarios.
Solution: Use caching mechanisms or consider Amazon FSx for specific applications.
Compatibility with Windows Workloads:
Why Not? EFS uses NFS, which is not natively supported by Windows.
Alternative: Use Amazon FSx for Windows File Server for SMB-based storage.
How EFS Works
Creation:
An EFS file system is created within a VPC.
It automatically creates mount targets in specified subnets of different Availability Zones.
Mount Targets:
These are network endpoints that enable EC2 instances to access the EFS.
Each subnet in an AZ will have one mount target with its private IP.
Mounting EFS to EC2 Instances:
Command:
sudo mount -t nfs4 -o nfsvers=4.1 <EFS-MOUNT-TARGET-IP>:/ /mnt/efs
EFS must be mounted on each instance that needs access to the file system.
Persisting Mounts Across Reboots:
Add an entry in /etc/fstab:
<EFS-MOUNT-TARGET-IP>:/ /mnt/efs nfs4 defaults,_netdev 0 0
EFS Lifecycle Management
Standard Storage Class:
Default storage for frequently accessed files.
Infrequent Access (IA) Storage Class:
Cost-effective storage for files not accessed frequently.
Automatically transitions files based on lifecycle policies.
EFS Compatibility with EC2
Supported Instances:
All EC2 instances running Linux distributions support EFS natively.
Windows Instances:
Windows doesn't natively support NFS but can use third-party NFS clients such as WinNFS or HaneWIN.
Instances in Different VPCs:
Why Not? Instances in different VPCs cannot access EFS unless connected via VPC peering, transit gateways, or AWS PrivateLink.
AWS Services Similar to EFS
Amazon S3:
Object storage for unstructured data.
Best for static assets, backups, and data archiving.
Amazon EBS:
Block storage for single EC2 instances.
Best for databases and transactional workloads.
Amazon FSx:
Fully managed file systems for Windows (SMB) and high-performance workloads (Lustre).
Ideal for Windows-based applications and HPC.
Pricing Considerations
EFS:
Pay-per-use for storage and data transfer.
Higher costs compared to other storage services.
S3 Glacier:
Storage billed per GB, retrieval incurs additional costs.
Example:
Storage: 100GB in Glacier and 50GB in Glacier Deep Archive.
Billing: Only storage cost until data is retrieved.
FAQs and Important Notes
What is VPC Peering?
Enables resources in different VPCs to communicate as if in the same network.
What is Amazon FSx?
Managed file systems for specific use cases:
FSx for Windows File Server for SMB.
FSx for Lustre for HPC and big data.
Why Doesnâ€™t Windows Support EFS?
EFS uses NFS, which is designed for Linux systems.
Windows uses SMB natively for file sharing.
Conclusion
Amazon EFS is a powerful tool for Linux-based workloads requiring scalable, shared file storage. However, it's essential to evaluate use cases and understand its limitations. For scenarios like block storage, Windows compatibility, or archival, consider alternatives like Amazon EBS, S3, or FSx.
